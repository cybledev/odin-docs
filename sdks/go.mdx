</Info>

ODIN's primary focus is to equip infosec teams with a precise depiction of the internet, enabling them to strengthen their security defences and proactively detect threats within their attack surface.

The Odin SDK for Go provides a simple way to interact with the [Odin API](https://getodin.com/docs/api) and access various services related to cybersecurity, and more.

## Installation

To use the Odin SDK in your Go project, you need to install it using the `go get` command:

```bash
go get github.com/cybledev/odin-sdk-go@v2
```

## Usage

<CodeGroup>
```golang Example
import github.com/cybledev/odin-sdk-go@v2

func ApiKeyAuth() runtime.ClientAuthInfoWriter {
    return runtime.ClientAuthInfoWriterFunc(func(r runtime.ClientRequest, \_ strfmt.Registry) error {
        return r.SetHeaderParam("x-api-key", os.Getenv("<APIKey>"))
    })
}

limit := int64(10)
esr := models.ExposedSearchRequest{
    Limit:   &limit,
    Query:   "provider: aws",
    SortBy:  "files",
    SortDir: "desc",
}

buckets := []*models.ExposedBucket{}
searchParams := exposed_buckets.NewPostV1ExposedBucketsSearchParamsWithContext(ctx).WithQuery(&esr)
resp, err := client.ExposedBuckets.PostV1ExposedBucketsSearch(searchParams, apiKeyAuth())
```
</CodeGroup>

## Examples

You can find various usage examples demonstrating how to interact with the Odin API in the [Example](https://github.com/cybledev/odin-sdk-go/tree/odin/odin_client_test.go) file.

<Warning>
Make sure to replace `<APIKey>` with your actual [Odin API key from the odin dashboard](https://odin.io/account/profile/api-keys).
</Warning>
